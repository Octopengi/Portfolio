            <p>For roughly the past four years, I've been working hard to learn about computer science and various programming languages. 
                I started to show interest in programming in sixth grade, when a friend of mine showed me a project he'd made on a block coding website. 
                At the end of eigth grade I had the opporunity to apply to attend the <a href="https://www.monroecti.org/" target="_blank">Monroe Career and Technical Institue</a> in Pennsylvania for all four years of highschool, where I proceeded to study the field of computer science. 
                During my four years there, I developed an incredible background and understanding of the Python programming language, while briefly touching a few other languages as well. 
                Alongside working with programming languages I've gained an advanced understanding of logic, which has been useful to me in more areas than just computers.
            </p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been in love with video games. It was my favorite pastime as a kid, and remains to be one of my favorites today. 
                Video games have influenced me in so many different ways through their characters and stories, and have inspired me to work on my own ideas in hopes of making them a reality someday. 
                Recently I have been watching analyses on video games as well, and have started developing a sense of how games should be designed. 
                With how important video games have become to me, my main career interest has become to work with them in the future. 
                While it is a very competitive industry I'm willing to work hard enough to thrive in this environment.
            </p>
